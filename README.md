## Introduction to Javascript

First, you should know that Javascript is a horrible language.  But, it currently provides an important
substrate in every web application, so we should get familiar with it.

More recent Javascript versions are called ES5, ES2015, ES6, and CoffeeScript.  They attempt to improve
the language, with some success.

We will learn some "raw" Javascript, though most web devs don't know much raw Javascript.  They use code libraries
that provide a higher level of abstraction.  We will look at jQuery, the most popular of these.
